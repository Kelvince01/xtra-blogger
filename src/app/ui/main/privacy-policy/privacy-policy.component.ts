              We use cookies on the Websites for Google Analytics (the "Analytics Service"). The
              Analytics Service is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how
              visitors engage with their website. The Analytics Service customers can view a variety
              of reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many services, the Analytics Service uses first-party cookies to track visitor
              interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how
              visitors use the Websites. We then use the information to compile reports and to help
              us improve the Websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. These
              cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current visit
              occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the
              visitor to the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. It reports website trends
              without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of the Analytics Service
              without affecting how you visit the Websites. For more information on opting out of
              being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit

              (“Creators”) with a monetary payment conducted via integration with third-party
              payment platform, such as Stripe or PayPal. Such third-party payment platforms have
              their own terms of service and privacy policies which you as either a Sponsor or a
              Creator will need to accept in order to conduct a Sponsorship, and you will need to
              provide such applicable information to the third-party payment platform. Xtra Blog

              on the Service or in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or
              otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or
              survey, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to
              control such uses of your information, and by using the Service or any other online

            <h2>9. Security:</h2>
            <p>
              The security of your information is very important to us. We have implemented measures
              designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
              unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, due to the inherent
              open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your information will be
              completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use
              of our Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk. Only those employees who
              need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to
              have access to your information. For more information on protecting your privacy,
              please visit

              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Specific steps we take to secure and protect your data include, but are not limited
              to:
            </p>
            <p>
              Encrypting the connection between our website and your computer;
              <br />
              Ensuring the physical and digital security of the servers holding your data;
              <br />
              Controlling the access Our staff and contractors have to the data to ensure that only
              authorised personnel are able to access the data.
              <br />
              Notwithstanding the security measures that We take, it is important to remember that
              the transmission of data via the internet may not be completely secure and that you
              are advised to take suitable precautions when transmitting to Us data via the
              internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given
              you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Websites
              or Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not
              to share your password with anyone
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
              secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot
              guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Websites or
              Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not
              responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
              on the Websites or Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              We only keep your data for as long as We need to in order to use it as described
              above, or for as long as We have your permission to keep it. In any event, We will
              conduct an annual review to ascertain whether we need to keep your data. Your data
              will be deleted if we no longer need it in accordance with the terms of our Data
              Retention Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some or all of your data may be stored or transferred outside of the European Economic
              Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and
              Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this by using The Websites and
              submitting information to Us. If We do store or transfer data outside the EEA, We will
              take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely
              as it would be within the EEA and under the GDPR. Such steps may include, but not be
              limited to, the use of legally binding contractual terms between Us and any third
              parties We engage and the use of the EU-approved Model Contractual Arrangements.

            <h2>10. Protection for Children:</h2>
            <p>
              We do not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of
              13. If at any time in the future we plan to collect personally identifiable
              information from children under 13, such collection and use, to the extent applicable,
              shall, when required, be done in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy
              Protection Act ("COPPA") and appropriate consent from the child’s parent or guardian
              will be sought where required by COPPA. When we become aware that personally
              identifiable information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s
              parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such
              information from our database. If you believe your child or minor guardian has
              provided us information without your consent, please contact us at
